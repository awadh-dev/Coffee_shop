Coffee Shop 

This is a basic object-oriented Python project that models a coffee shop's core entities: Customer, Coffee, and Order.




 It demonstrates relationships between objects, validation using properties, and includes functionality like tracking customer orders, calculating average coffee prices, and identifying the top-spending customer.


Features

-   **Customer Class:**
    -   Represents a customer with a name.
    -   Includes properties and setters for the customer's name with validation (ensuring it's a string and within a specific length).
    -   Provides methods to:
        -   Retrieve the customer's orders.
        -   Get a list of unique coffees the customer has ordered.
        -   Create a new order for the customer.
        -   Find the "most aficionado" customer for a given coffee (the customer who has spent the most on that coffee).

-   **Order Class:**
    -   Represents an order placed by a customer for a specific coffee.
    -   (Based on the code snippets) likely includes attributes for the customer, coffee, and price.

-   **Coffee Class**
    - Represents the type of coffee.
    - (Based on the code snippets) likely includes attributes for the name, and possibly other details.
